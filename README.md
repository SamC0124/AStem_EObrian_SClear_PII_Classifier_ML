## AStem_EObrian_SClear_PII_Classifier_ML

Our project is focused on identifying whether a particular source (documents which either contain essays written by students, or posts generated from data online) contains Personally-Identifying Information (PII) or not, such as names, addresses, or phone numbers to name a few. Our current model predicts correctly whether a document contains PIIs 87% of the time for both synthetic and human-generated documents, however is far less accurate for documents which are only human-generated.
